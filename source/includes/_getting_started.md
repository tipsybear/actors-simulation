# Getting Started
> Use the setup.py script to install

```python
# view with the "shell" tab
```

```shell
$ python setup.py install
```

The simplest way to install the simulator is to use the `setup.py` script included with this repository as shown in the example code.

This will install our simulation library to your Python site-pacakges as well as install a `simulate.py` utility into your path. Of course you can also follow the development instructions found in the readme. In order to run the simulation, use the `simulate.py` utility as follows:

> Run the simulation withe the `simulate.py` utility

```python
# view with the "shell" tab
```

```shell
$ simulate.py run <simulation>
```

`$ simulate.py run <simulation>`

Where `<simulation>` is the name of the simulation you'd like to run.
